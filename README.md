# CIFAR-10 CNN with FGSM Adversarial Attacks

## Overview

This project involves training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on the CIFAR-10 dataset using Keras and TensorFlow. The implementation includes the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) for adversarial attacks. The aim is to evaluate the model's performance on both clean and adversarially perturbed images.

## Requirements

- TensorFlow 2.x
- NumPy

Install the required packages using:

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy
```
Clone the repository
Run the code:  
```bash 
python KerasClassifier.py
```
